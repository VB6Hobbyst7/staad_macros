STAAD Macros
============

STAAD Pro is a Bentley systems software, popular with Structural Designers for finite element analysis and design of structures based on various codes and standards. 

Macros allow programmatic control of the software from inside STAAD Pro. 

Included code samples are written in VBA and are heavily commented to make the code easy to understand. 

## A short introduction to OpenSTAAD (the STAAD API) can be found here: http://chintanp.github.io/staad_macros 

Edit: Added files beam_data.xlsx and std model referred in the code.
